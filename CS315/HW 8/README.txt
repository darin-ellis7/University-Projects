---------Files------------
The code is all in one file, HW8.py. When run (on any interpreter that
handles python 3.X) it should prompt you to select what sorts to run and how.

---------Using the program----------

The program will first ask for the algorithm you want to use:

1 = Selection
2 = Insertion
3 = Quicksort (random pivot)
4 = Quicksort (first pivot)
5 = Mergesort

Then it will ask for input array type:

1 = backwards
2 = already sorted
3 = consecutive pairs swapped
4 = random

It will then prompt for an n value, where n is the number of elements in
the array. 

It will then report the unsorted array, and sorted array, and number of
comparisons. Then it will repeat. Manually close the program to exit.
